1. Class and Obj (example)
2. Class has data/Attribute and func/Method
    > code walkthrough
    > attribute get called itself, method are called manually
3. Why python is called OOOP? - everything in python is an object (data structure, data type)
4. Advantages of OOP:
    > You can create your own data type
    > code reusability
    > debugging
    > easy to colab
5. End to end Project (Chatbook class)
    > function vs method
    > magic method or dunder method
    > self
    > you can create attribute outside the class as well
    > Encapsulation 
    > Getter and setter
    > Staic method

6. Inheritance
    > Inheritance code example
    > why inheritance is needed? (code reusability, parent has no acces to child class)
    > what gets inherited? - Constructor, Non private  attributes, Non private methods
    > constructor overloading & method overloading
    > super keyword (can be used only inside class, can not acces variables/attributes, use only inside chaild class)
    > Types of inheritance - 1. Single Inheritance | 2. Multilevel | 3. Hierarchical | 4. Multiple <Diamond problem> | 5. Hybrid
